# Running
Note to self:
- Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:murriel/read.murrielgrace.com.git`
- Enter directory `cd read.murrielgrace.com`
- Create branch `git checkout -b feature\some-name`
- To launch and view site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This will launch a local web server, probably at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ Using this URL you can view and test changes to your site.
