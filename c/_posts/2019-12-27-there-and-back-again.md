Writing has always been a consistent and important part of my life. read.murrielgrace.com was initially intended as living documentation to complement the portfolio site at www.murrielgrace.com but fell into a state of disrepair for many moons as other priorities and distractions replaced my writing habit.

After a valiant battle with Jekyll theming, various stops and starts, and a healthy end-of-year refactoring round, we have arrived here at the first official revision of this website.

The collections here will eventually capture and chronicle projects, talks, and publications - along with various ramblings. For now, I am embracing imperfect releases and frequent iterations in my So-Called Agile Life and work. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me - as of yet I do not know where it will lead.
