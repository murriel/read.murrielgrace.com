# Talk Abstract
Many workers in the tech industry have had the luxury of being able to work remotely, whether occasionally remote or completely remote. In this time of (novel) Coronavirus/COVID-19, an unprecedented number of companies are sending large if not entire portions of their workforce home to work remotely and prevent spread of the virus.

Given this current state of affairs: How do we manage our time? How do we stay motivated to continue working on aspirational projects or self-directed learning when our home and work life and our schedules are upside down? How do we manage anxiety and mental health with so much uncertainty? These are questions that I have been attempting to answer for myself as I start a new job at a new company in the midst of all this and find myself trying to understand this brave new sick world.

While I am still trying to navigate the answers to these questions, I can talk about my own methods and some mini Python learning projects that I am attempting to work on in the meantime.
